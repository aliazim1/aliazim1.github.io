        experience: "Dominican Republic is a beautiful place to go because the people are very welcoming and friendly. \
        I did not know that much Spanish but everytime I walked into a store then greeted them with «Hola como estas» I received \
        a nice friendly smile from them. I had not seen that so long since coming to America. I didn’t have any challenges in this \
        experience except getting my passport the day before I travel. Academically, I would say that somehow I don’t know why but after \
        visiting multiple schools in the DR, it opened my eyes on globe disparities such education system and healthcare access. Also I improved \
        my communication skills with people with different backgrounds.",
        advice: 'If you have not traveled to this country, please take this opportunity to gain some knowledge and experience. You will \
        enjoy everything in the DR. I do not think Seita Program would let me go again otherwise I will do again and again (every year).',

        I make it a point to try to spend individual time with each student either during the class or while we are abroad. I enjoy learning \
        from the students as much as from The experience abroad itself. Also, it's an honor having the chance to see the country through their \
        eyes provides new insights for me each time.",
        advice: "Please at least consider it. A lot of students think they can't go because they won't be able to afford it but please talk to\
         your coach before counting it out. Also, please get your passport as soon as possible.",
