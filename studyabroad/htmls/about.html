                <h2>Event</h2>
                <p>On the sixth day of our study abroad, we visited the Children's International. A group of youths 
                    (talented youths) gave an impressive performance combining dancing and painting. They were young 
                    but very professional in their performance. As they were dancing, they completed their painting as well. 
                    There was no verbal communication and yet they were highly organized.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="learn-section">
                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>This performance had a profound impact on me as I was watching them combining
                    dancing and painting; it gave me a sense of wonder and admiration. It was amazing to see
                    those young individuals perform at such a level of professionalism and skills which are
                    often attributed to more experienced artists. This performance created a unique
                    experience, it highlighted the endless possibilities of artistic expression which made the
                    performance more engaging and memorable. Also, this performance and many other ones we watched, 
                    proves how excellent and successful the Children's International program is. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="learn-section">
                <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
                <p>I learned several lessons from this performance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personally, it taught me the value of dedication and practice. By watching this performance, 
                        I learned what we can achieve through hard work and perseverance.</li>
                    <li> It taught me the value of pushing boundaries and potential that lies in exploring new and
                         innovative ways to express myself.</li>
                    <li>Another lesson I learned is that age is not necessarily a barrier to achieving excellence.</li>
                    <li>Academically, this performance taught me the importance of creativity and innovation. I learned to be more 
                        open-mind and willing to explore unconventional ways to combine different fields of interest to come up with
                         better and more innovative solutions to any problems.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="learn-section">
                <h2>How this lesson is practical?</h2>
                <p class="last-p">As a computer Science student, I can apply these lessons not only in artistic endeavors but also 
                    in problem-solving in my future studies and career by practicing over and over, thinking creatively, pushing 
                    bounderies, testing and iterating solutions, staying open-minded, and communicating effectively with team members, 
                    both verbally and non-verbally.</p>
